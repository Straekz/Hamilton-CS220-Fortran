This respository is my Term Project from my Principles of Programming Languages course (CPSCI 220) at Hamilton College Spring 2024.
I learned Fortran on my own using various resources and wrote my own programs to increase my understanding of the language.
Then I wrote a final term paper that contained my cumulative understanding of the language.
